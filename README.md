# E-commerce Back End App

This is an app that uses dotenv, mysql, sequelize and insomnia to demonstrate an API driven e-commerce backend to track products and the related data that would go along with having product inventory.

Instructions to start:

Clone the repo;
log into MYSQL with your credentials;
run "source db/schema.sql;
close mySQL;
from your CLI, run "npm run seed" to seed the database;
finally, "npm start" to launch the app.

here is a demo video of my app in action!
